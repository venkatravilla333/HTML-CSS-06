                                         CSS CONTENT
                                         ===========


1. What is CSS
   ===========

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is a styling language, by using CSS we can style the html content or elements on webpage by using CSS properties. CSS properties will be in key value pair. 


2. How many ways we can add css to html elements
   =============================================


   1) Inline 

   - By using style attribute we can apply css directly to that html element. By using inline style we can apply only css to only one element at a time.

   2) Internal

   - By using style tag in head tag we can apply css to many html elements in the same html file at a time html elements. 

   3) Extrenal

   - By using external style sheet we can apply css to many html elements in different html files at a time. We can link external css file to html file by using link tag in head tag.


   3. CSS selectors
   =============
 
  - CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style.

  - We can divide CSS selectors into several categories:

   1. Simple selectors (select elements based on tag, id, class) (3 selectors)

   2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)

      a) Descendent selector => div p {} - all childs
      b) Child selector      => div>p {} - direct childs    
      c) Adjacent sibling    => div+p {} - next one (sibling)
      d) General sibling     => div~p {} - next all siblings

   3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)

   4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)

   5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) (4 selectors)

   6. Universal Selector (The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page)

   7. Grouping Selector (To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma)

      Allows you to apply the same styles to multiple selectors.

      Example: h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }


1.Type (Element) Selector:
  -----------------------

Selects elements by their HTML tag name.

Example: p { color: blue; }

2.Class Selector:
  --------------

Selects elements by their class attribute.

Example: .my-class { font-weight: bold; }

3.ID Selector:
  -----------

Selects a single element by its unique ID attribute.

Example: #my-id { background-color: yellow; }

4.Universal Selector:
  ------------------

Selects all elements on the page.

Example: * { margin: 0; }

5.Descendant Selector (all childs):
  -------------------

Selects an element that is a descendant of another element.

Example: ul li { list-style: square; }

6.Child Selector (direct child):
  --------------

Selects an element that is a direct child of another element.

Example: ul > li { font-style: italic; }

7.Adjacent Sibling Selector (next sibling):
  -------------------------

Selects an element that is immediately preceded by another element.

Example: h2 + p { color: red; }

8.General Sibling Selector (next all siblings):
  ------------------------

Selects elements that are siblings of a specified element.

Example: h2 ~ p { font-size: 18px; }


9.Pseudo-Class Selector:
   ---------------------

Selects elements based on a specific state or interaction, such as :hover, :active, and :focus.

Example: a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }

10.Pseudo-Element Selector:
   -----------------------

Selects and styles a part of an element's content, such as  

=> ::first-letter ::first-line and ::before and ::after

Example: p::before { content: "Note: "; }

Pseudo-elements in CSS are used to style a specific part of an element. They are denoted by double colons (::) and are often used with the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to insert content before or after an element. Here's an example of using the ::before pseudo-element to add content before an element:

.myclass::before {
  content: "This is content";
  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;
}

.myclass::after {
  content: "This is content";
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
}


11.Grouping Selector:
   -----------------

Allows you to apply the same styles to multiple selectors.

Example: h1, h2, h3 { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }


12.Attribute Selector:
  ------------------

Selects elements based on the value of their attributes.

Example: input[type="text"] { border: 1px solid #ccc; }



13.Attribute Value Starts With Selector:
   ------------------------------------

Selects elements whose attribute values start with a specified string.

Example: [href^="https://"] { color: blue; }

14.Attribute Value Ends With Selector:
   ----------------------------------

Selects elements whose attribute values end with a specified string.

Example: [src$=".jpg"] { border: 1px solid #ccc; }

15.Attribute Value Contains Selector:
   ---------------------------------

Selects elements whose attribute values contain a specified string.

Example: [alt*="cat"] { border: 2px solid orange; }



5. Text Properties 
   ===============

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides a wide range of text properties that allow you to control the appearance and layout of text within HTML elements. A list of common text properties in CSS.


1.color:
  -----
 
Sets the color of the text.
Example: color: red;

2.direction:
  ---------

Sets the text direction, such as ltr (left-to-right) or rtl (right-to-left).
Example: direction: rtl;

3.text-transform:
  --------------

Modifies the capitalization of text, e.g., uppercase or lowercase or capitalize.
Example: text-transform: uppercase;

4.text-shadow:
  -----------

It gives shadow to text.
 
text-shadow: x-axis y-axis blur color
text-shadow: 10px 0px 10px red

5.text-align:
  ----------

Aligns the text horizontally within its container.
Example: text-align: center;

6.text-decoration:
  ---------------

Controls decorations like underline, overline, and line-through.
Example: text-decoration: underline;

7.text-indent:
   -----------

Sets the indentation of the first line of text within an element.
Example: text-indent: 20px;


8.font-family:
  -----------

Specifies the font family for the text.
Example: font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

9.font-size:
   ---------

Sets the size of the text.
Example: font-size: 16px;

10.font-weight:
   -----------

Defines the thickness or boldness of the text.
Example: font-weight: bold;

11.font-style:
   ----------

Specifies the style of the text, such as italic.
Example: font-style: italic;


12.line-height:
   -----------

Sets the height of a line of text, controlling spacing between lines.
Example: line-height: 1.5;


13.letter-spacing:
  --------------

Adjusts the space between individual characters.
Example: letter-spacing: 2px;

14.word-spacing:
  ------------

Controls the spacing between words in a block of text.
Example: word-spacing: 4px;

These are some of the essential text properties in CSS. By using these properties, you can customize the appearance and layout of text on your web pages, making it an integral part of web design and typography.



6. Background Properties
   =====================


1.background-color:
  ---------------

<style>
  .example {
    background-color: #F0F0F0;
  }
</style>

<div class="example">
  This is a div with a colored background.
</div>

2.background-image:
  ----------------

<style>
  .example {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
  }
</style>

<div class="example">
  This is a div with a background image.
</div>


3.background-repeat: ( repeat (default) | repeat-x | repeat-y | no-repeat )
  -----------------

=> Repeating horizontally and vertically 

.example-repeat {
    background-image: url('repeating-pattern.png');
    background-repeat: repeat;
}

=> Repeating horizontally only 

.example-repeat-x {
    background-image: url('horizontal-pattern.png');
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

=> Repeating vertically only 

.example-repeat-y {
    background-image: url('vertical-pattern.png');
    background-repeat: repeat-y;
}

=> No repetition 

.example-no-repeat {
    background-image: url('single-image.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

ex:
--

<style>
  .example {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
  }
</style>

<div class="example">
  This is a div with a non-repeating background image.
</div>


4.background-position:   left top | left center | left bottom | right top | right center |
  ------------------     right bottom | center top | center center | center bottom
  

<style>
  .example {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-position: center top;
  }
</style>

<div class="example">
  This is a div with a centered top-aligned background image.
</div>


5.background-size:
  ---------------

=> Original size (auto) 

.example-auto {
    background-image: url('large-image.jpg');
    background-size: auto;
}

=> Scale to cover the content area 

.example-cover {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
}

=> Scale to fit within the content area

.example-contain {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-size: contain;
}

=> Specific size in pixels 

.example-specific-size {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-size: 200px 150px;
}

=> Relative size with percentages 

.example-percent-size {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-size: 50% 75%;
}

Ex:

<style>
  .example {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
  }
</style>

<div class="example">
  This is a div with a background image that covers the entire element.
</div>

Note:
----

The 'cover' tells the browser to cover the whole area of an element. 
The 'contain' tells the browser to show the whole image without loosing image.


6.background-attachment: (scroll | fixed)
  ---------------------

=> Background image scrolls with content (default) 

.example-scroll {
    background-image: url('scrolling-background.jpg');
    background-attachment: scroll;
}

=> Background image remains fixed in place

.example-fixed {
    background-image: url('fixed-background.jpg');
    background-attachment: fixed;
}

Ex:
--

<style>
  .example {
    background-image: url('image.jpg');
    background-attachment: fixed;
  }
</style>

<div class="example">
  This is a div with a fixed background image.
</div>


These are just a few examples of how you can use CSS background properties to style and enhance the backgrounds of HTML elements. You can combine these properties and adjust their values to achieve the desired visual effects in your web pages.



7. Border properties
   =================

In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you can use various properties to control the appearance of borders around elements such as text, images, and containers. Here are some common border properties in CSS:

1)border-width:
--------------

This property sets the width of the border. You can specify the width in pixels, ems, rems, percentages, or other units. 

border-width: 2px;

2)border-color:
-------------- 
This property sets the color of the border. You can use color names, hexadecimal values, RGB values, or other color notations. 

border-color: #FF0000;


3)border-style:
-------------- 

This property sets the style of the border, and it can take values like "solid," "dashed," "dotted," "double," "none,". 

border-style: solid;


4)border-radius:
---------------
 
This property sets the radius of the corners of an element, creating rounded corners. You can specify different values for each corner or use a single value for all corners.

The border-radius property is actually a shorthand property for the 

border-top-left-radius, 
border-top-right-radius, 
border-bottom-right-radius 
border-bottom-left-radius 
 
border-radius: 10px;

5)border-image:
--------------
 
This property allows you to use an image as a border instead of a solid color. It's a more advanced property and requires defining an image to use as a border.

border-image: url(border-image.png) 27 27 27 27 round round;

      border-image-source: url('./102.PNG');
      border-image-slice: 30%;
      border-image-width: 20px;
      border-image-repeat: repeated, stretched(default).
      border-image-outset: 20px


border-image is a shorthand property that lets you use an image or CSS gradient as the border of an element.

The border-image property can be applied to any element, except internal table elements (e.g. tr, th, td) when border-collapse is set to collapse.

The border-image-outset property specifies the amount by which the border image area extends beyond the border box


border:
------ 

This is a shorthand property that combines border-width, border-style, and border-color into a single declaration.
 
border: (width) 1px (style)solid (color) #000;




8. Margin and Padding properties
   =============================

margin
------

The CSS margin property is used to give space around an element on a web page. It defines the area outside the element's border. Margins are used to create space and separation between elements.


1)margin-top: 10px;

2)margin-right: 20px;

3)margin-bottom: 15px;

4)margin-left: 25px;

5)margin: 10px 20px 15px 25px; (top, right, bottom, left) 

6)margin: 10px 20px   (Top and bottom have 10px margin, right and left have 20px margin)
 
7)margin: 10px 20px 15px   (Top has 10px margin, right and left have 20px margin, bottom has 15px margin) 
8)margin: 10px  (all sides)

9)margin: auto

You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.
The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

Margin Collapse
---------------

Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!


padding
-------

Padding is used to create space within an element, between the element's content and its border.


1)padding-top: 10px;

2)padding-right: 20px;

3)padding-bottom: 15px;

4)padding-left: 25px;

5)padding: 10px 20px 15px 25px; /* top, right, bottom, left */

6)padding: 10px 20px  

7)padding: 10px 20px 15px

8)padding: 10px (all sides)


margin vs padding
-----------------

In CSS, both margin and padding are properties used to control spacing, but they affect the layout of elements in different ways:

Margin:
------

-Margin controls space outside an element, between the element's border and neighboring elements.
-Margins create separation between elements.
-Margin values can be positive (adding space) or negative (reducing space).
-Margin do not have a background color or visible area, they only affect the spacing between elements.
-Margins can "collapse" under certain conditions, meaning that if two adjacent elements have margins, the larger of the two margins is used, and they don't stack.

Ex:

div {
  margin: 10px;
}

In this example, a div element will have a 10-pixel margin around it, creating space between it and neighboring elements.

Margin collapse
---------------

The concept of "margin collapsing" in CSS refers to how margins between adjacent elements are computed when they are touching or close to each other. When two or more vertical margins meet or overlap under specific conditions, they don't simply add up or stack on top of each other as you might expect. Instead, they collapse, and the larger of the two margins is used to create the space between the elements. Here's a more detailed explanation:

=> Margins Collapsing Conditions:

Margins can collapse in the following situations:

When two or more block-level elements are vertically adjacent, meaning they are stacked on top of each other in the document flow.
When there is no padding, border, or inline content separating the elements.
When the margins are of the same type (e.g., both are top margins or both are bottom margins).

=> Result of Margin Collapsing:

When margins collapse, the larger of the margins is used, and the smaller margin effectively disappears in terms of creating spacing.
This means that if one element has a margin of 10px, and the adjacent element has a margin of 20px, the effective spacing between them will be 20px, not 30px.

=> Preventing Margin Collapsing:

You can prevent margin collapsing by introducing a non-collapsible element between the two elements. For example, adding padding, a border, or inline content between the elements will stop margin collapsing.

Example of margin collapsing:


p {
  margin: 10px 0;
}

div {
  margin: 20px 0;
}

In this example, if a <p> element and a <div> element are placed next to each other, the effective vertical space between them will be 20px, not 30px, because the larger of the two margins (20px) takes precedence



Padding:
-------

-Padding controls the space inside an element, between the element's content and its border.
-Padding is used to create space within an element, affecting the content's position within the   element's boundaries.
-Padding values can be positive (adding space) and are never negative.
-Padding has a background color and visible area. It extends the background of the element.

EX:

div {
  padding: 10px;
}

In this example, a div element will have a 10-pixel padding inside it, pushing the content away from the border.


Note: Inline elements vertical padding
====

In CSS, inline elements, by default, do not respect vertical padding in the same way that block-level elements do. Vertical padding on inline elements will not push away adjacent inline elements. Instead, it may cause overlapping or wrapping of the content within the inline element.

When you apply vertical padding to an inline element, such as <span> or a text within a paragraph, it increases the height of the element but doesn't create space around it like it does with block-level elements. This means that if you have multiple inline elements with padding, they might overlap or wrap to the next line depending on the available space within their container.

If you want to create space around inline elements, you can use margin instead of padding, or you can change the display property of the elements to inline-block or inline-flex, which will make them behave more like block-level elements, respecting vertical padding and margin.

<p>
  <span class="inline">This is some text.</span>
  <span class="inline">This is some text with padding.</span>
</p>
CSS:


span.inline {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

In this example, the padding will increase the height of each inline element, but the adjacent inline elements won't be pushed away. They may overlap or wrap to the next line depending on the available width of the containing element. If you want to create space between these inline elements, you would need to use margin or consider changing the display property to make them behave like block-level elements.



9. Width and height properties
   ===========================

Note: width and height in % => depends on  parent's width and height.
====

 - width = Width will be always fixed irrespective of screen size.

 - min-width = min-width is fixed for given size and beyong min-width it depends on screen size.
  
 - max-width = max-width is fixed for given size and below max-width it depends on screen size.

 - height = Height is fixed it will not be depend on screen size.

 - min-height = min-height is fixed for given size and beyond min-height depends on screen size.

 - max-height = max-height is fixed for given size and below max-height it depends on screen size.


Ex:

In CSS, height, min-height, and max-height are properties used to control the height of an element, such as a container or a block-level element. They serve different purposes and have distinct effects:

height:
------

The height property sets the exact height of an element to a specific value in pixels, ems, rems, percentages, or other length units. This value is often fixed and doesn't change unless you explicitly modify it.
If the content inside the element exceeds the specified height, it may overflow and be hidden or affect the layout of surrounding elements unless you use additional CSS properties to manage overflow, like overflow: hidden or overflow: scroll.

.element {
  height: 200px;
}

min-height:
----------

The min-height property sets the minimum height that an element should have. It ensures that the element is at least as tall as the specified value, but it can expand beyond that height if needed to accommodate content or other factors.
If the content within the element is taller than the specified min-height, the element's height will adjust to fit the content.

.element {
  min-height: 100px;
}

max-height:
----------

The max-height property sets the maximum height that an element can have. It restricts the height to not exceed the specified value. If the content or other factors would cause the element to be taller than the max-height, it will be limited to that height, and scrollbars may appear to allow users to access the overflow content.

.element {
  max-height: 300px;
}

You can use these properties individually or in combination to control the height of elements in your web page layout. They are particularly useful when dealing with responsive web design, ensuring that elements adapt to various screen sizes and content while maintaining a defined range of height.




10. Display Property
    ================

In CSS, the display property is used to control how an HTML element is displayed in the web browser. It defines the type of box an element generates, which in turn affects its layout and rendering on the web page. There are various display property values that determine the element's behavior. Here are some common display property values:

1.block:
-------

The element is displayed as a block-level element.
It takes up the full width available in its parent container and starts on a new line.
Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, and <h1>.

2.inline:
--------

The element is displayed as an inline-level element.
It takes up only as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.
Examples of inline-level elements include <span>, <a>, and <strong>.

3.inline-block:
--------------

Combines characteristics of both inline and block.
The element is inline, but it can have its own width and height, as well as margin and padding.
Elements with this display type can be positioned inline, but they can have block-level styling.

Note:
----

=> inline The element doesn’t start on a new line and only occupy just the width it requires. You can’t set the width or height.

=> inline-block It’s formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height values.

=> block element will start on a new line and occupy the full width available. And you can set width and height values.


4.none:
------

The element is not displayed at all, effectively making it invisible.
It doesn't occupy any space in the layout.

5.table:
-------

The element is displayed as a table element.
It can have child elements with table-row, table-cell, and other table-related display values.

6.flex:
------

The element becomes a flex container, and its children become flex items.
It is used to create flexible and responsive layouts, allowing elements to adjust their sizes based on available space.

7.grid:
------

The element becomes a grid container, and its children become grid items.
It is used to create grid-based layouts, providing fine control over the arrangement of items.


display: none vs visibility: hidden vs opacity: 0
=================================================

In CSS, display: none, visibility: hidden, and opacity: 0 are three different ways to hide elements on a web page, and they have distinct behaviors and use cases.

display: none
-------------

When you apply display: none to an element, the element is completely removed from the layout of the page. It takes up no space, and the document flows as if the element does not exist.
Child elements of the hidden element are also hidden, and they do not affect the layout.
Events and interactions (e.g., clicking, hovering) cannot target hidden elements.
Good for situations where you want to completely remove an element from view and layout.

element {
  display: none;
}

visibility: hidden
------------------

When you apply visibility: hidden to an element, the element is still part of the layout, but it is not visible. It still takes up space on the page, as if it were still visible. Child elements of the hidden element are also hidden, but they still affect the layout. Events and interactions can still target hidden elements. Useful when you want to hide an element but maintain its space in the layout.

element {
  visibility: hidden;
}

opacity: 0
----------

When you set opacity: 0, the element becomes fully transparent, but it still occupies the same space in the layout.
Child elements of the transparent element remain visible and affect the layout.
Events and interactions can target the transparent elements.
Useful when you want to hide an element while maintaining its layout position and possibly animate the element's visibility.

element {
  opacity: 0;
}

In summary, the choice of which property to use (display, visibility, or opacity) depends on your specific requirements. If you want to completely remove the element and its space from the layout, display: none is suitable. If you want to hide the element but maintain its space in the layout, visibility: hidden is appropriate. If you want to hide the element but keep its space and potentially use transitions or animations, opacity: 0 is a good choice.
