What is HTML
------------

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used to structure content on the web page.HTML uses tags to structure content on the web. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. HTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language that uses tags to format text, images, audio, video on a webpage.

Here are some key points about HTML:

1) Markup Language:
 
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It uses tags to display text, images, and other content on a web page.

2) Structural Hierarchy:
 
HTML documents are organized hierarchically. They have a root element <html> that contains two childs sections: <head> (which contains meta-information and links to external resources) and <body> (which contains main content displayed in web browser).

3) Elements and Tags:
 
HTML documents are made up of elements. Elements are defined using tags. For example, a paragraph is defined using the <p> tag: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>. Tags typically come in pairs, with an opening tag <p> and a closing tag </p>. The content is placed between these tags.

4) Attributes:
 
Many HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element or modify its behavior. For example, the <img> element can have an "src" attribute to specify the image file source.

 -Web developers use HTML to create the structure and content of web pages, and then they use CSS    to style those pages and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality.


Basic tags
==========

<!DOCTYPE>: Specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.

<html>: The root element that contains all other HTML elements on the page.

<head>: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, and linked  stylesheets or scripts and meta tags.

<title>: Defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

<meta>: Provides metadata about document.

<link>: Links external resources such as stylesheets and icons.

<script>: Embeds or references JavaScript code/file.

<style>: Defines CSS for styling the page.

<body>: Contains the main content of the webpage, including text, images, audio, video and other elements.


meta tags
=========

The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

1) <meta charset="UTF-8">: 
   Specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is widely used for encoding text in various languages.To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.
   UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

2) <meta name="description" content="Your page description">: 
    Provides a brief summary or description of the web page's content. Search engines often use this information in search results.

3) <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: 
   Specifies a list of keywords or key phrases related to the page's content. However, this tag is no longer widely used by search engines to determine rankings.

4) <meta name="author" content="Author Name">: 
   Identifies the author of the web page's content.

5) <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
   Sets the initial scale and width of the viewport, important for responsive design.

6) <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="20">: 
   Automatically redirects the browser to another page after a specified time interval (in this case, 20 seconds).


=> html tags vs html elements vs html attributes. 


HTML Attributes
---------------

Html attributes are the properties of html element and it is used to give extra information about element to the browser. Every attribute will be in the key value pair.


Block-level abd Inline elements
-------------------------------

-A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

-An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.



HTML Elements
=============

1) Heading elements

13) Formatting Elements
    ===================

  
  Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text with css styles:

  Bold text: <b> or <strong>
  --------------------------

  HTML5 provides two tags to make text bold: <b> and <strong>.
  Both tags have the same effect of making the enclosed text bold, but <strong> is preferred because it indicates that the text is important for semantic purposes.

  Italicized text: <i> or <em>
  ----------------------------

  HTML5 provides two tags to make text italic: <i> and <em>. Both tags have the same effect of making the enclosed text italic, but <em> is preferred because it indicates that the text has emphasis for semantic purposes.

  Strike-through text: <del> or <s>
  ---------------------------------

  HTML5 provides two tags to make text strike-through: <s> and <del>. Both tags have the same effect of making the enclosed text strike-through, but <del> is preferred because it indicates that the text has been deleted for semantic purposes.

  Superscript and subscript text: <sup> or <sub>
  ----------------------------------------------

  HTML5 provides two tags to make text superscript and subscript: <sup> and <sub>, respectively.

  u and ins
  ---------
  HTML5 provides two tags u and ins. Both tags have the same effect of making underline.
  <ins> is used for semantic purpose. The <ins> tags means content inserted after it was first published. The <u> tag is simply for underlining and has no meaning.

  small vs big
  ------------
  In HTML, the <small> tag is used to emphasize small text or information that is of secondary significance, such as copyright and legal disclaimer.
  The <small> tag can be used to mark up a copyright notice or license agreement.

  HTML <big> tag was used to increase the text font size one level bigger than the document's base font size.


  <b> - Bold text
  <strong> - Important text

  <i> - Italic text
  <em> - Emphasized text

  <mark> - Highlighted Text

  <del> - Deleted text
  <s>  - text strick

  <ins> - Inserted text
  <u> - Underline text

  <sub> - Subscript text
  <sup> - Superscript text

  <small> - Smaller text
  <big> tag - Big Text



14) Table elements

  <caption>     - Defines a table caption
  <thead>	- Groups the header content in a table
  <tbody>	- Groups the body content in a table
  <tfoot>	- Groups the footer content in a table
  <tr>	        - Defines a row in a table (rows)
  <th>	        - Defines a header cell in a table (columns)
  <td>	        - Defines a data cell in a table (columns)
  
   Attributes:
   ----------
  1)

   border = '1' | '5' | '10' => if we use border then no need of frame and rules.    
   frame = box | border | above | below | hsides | vsides | lhs | rhs | void
   rules = all | rows | cols | groups | none

  2)

   width => It will effect the table header & table body & table footer. 
   height => It will give effect only to table body but not effect the table header(thead) & (tfoot) footer.

  3)

   cellspacing => It gives space between all cells.
   cellpadding => It gives space with in cells.

  4) 

   colspan => merging columns in specific row. 
   rowspan => merging rows in specific column.

  5) 

   text-align => text align horizontally.
   vertical-align => text align vertically.

  6)

   align = left | center | right

  7) 

   bgcolor => bg color to table.

   colspan
   ------
   Colspan is an attribute which assigns multiple columns to a cell of a table. The number of columns depends on the value entered by you in colspan="" attribute.

   rowspan
   -------
   Rowspan in table, works similar to the clospan for columns, but here, we assign multiple rows to a cell using an attribute rowspan=""

   horizontal alignment (text in table)
   ------------------------------------

   The text-align property sets the horizontal alignment (like left, right, or center) of the content in <th> or <td>.

   By default, the content of <th> elements are center-aligned and the content of <td> elements are left-aligned.

   vertical alignment (text in table)
   ----------------------------------

   The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment (like top, bottom, or middle) of the content in <th> or <td>.

   By default, the vertical alignment of the content in a table is middle (for both <th> and <td> elements).
