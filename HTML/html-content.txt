What is HTML
------------

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is used to structure content on the web page.HTML uses tags to structure content on the web. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. HTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language that uses tags to format text, images, audio, video on a webpage.

Here are some key points about HTML:

1) Markup Language:
 
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It uses tags to display text, images, and other content on a web page.

2) Structural Hierarchy:
 
HTML documents are organized hierarchically. They have a root element <html> that contains two childs sections: <head> (which contains meta-information and links to external resources) and <body> (which contains main content displayed in web browser).

3) Elements and Tags:
 
HTML documents are made up of elements. Elements are defined using tags. For example, a paragraph is defined using the <p> tag: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>. Tags typically come in pairs, with an opening tag <p> and a closing tag </p>. The content is placed between these tags.

4) Attributes:
 
Many HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element or modify its behavior. For example, the <img> element can have an "src" attribute to specify the image file source.

 -Web developers use HTML to create the structure and content of web pages, and then they use CSS    to style those pages and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality.


Basic tags
==========

<!DOCTYPE>: Specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.

<html>: The root element that contains all other HTML elements on the page.

<head>: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, and linked  stylesheets or scripts and meta tags.

<title>: Defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

<meta>: Provides metadata about document.

<link>: Links external resources such as stylesheets and icons.

<script>: Embeds or references JavaScript code/file.

<style>: Defines CSS for styling the page.

<body>: Contains the main content of the webpage, including text, images, audio, video and other elements.


meta tags
=========

The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

1) <meta charset="UTF-8">: 
   Specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is widely used for encoding text in various languages.To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.
   UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

2) <meta name="description" content="Your page description">: 
    Provides a brief summary or description of the web page's content. Search engines often use this information in search results.

3) <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: 
   Specifies a list of keywords or key phrases related to the page's content. However, this tag is no longer widely used by search engines to determine rankings.

4) <meta name="author" content="Author Name">: 
   Identifies the author of the web page's content.

5) <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: 
   Sets the initial scale and width of the viewport, important for responsive design.

6) <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="20">: 
   Automatically redirects the browser to another page after a specified time interval (in this case, 20 seconds).


=> html tags vs html elements vs html attributes. 


HTML Attributes
---------------

Html attributes are the properties of html element and it is used to give extra information about element to the browser. Every attribute will be in the key value pair.


Block-level abd Inline elements
